# This is a workaround to make the container's `resolv.conf` synchronized with the host's
# `resolv.conf`. To do that, we disallow docker from managing the container's DNS nameservers
# by unmounting the container's `/etc/resolv.conf`, and soft linking it to the binded host's
# `/etc/resolv.conf`.
# So for this to work, the container's `/etc/resolv.conf.host` file should be binded (read-only) to
# the host's `/etc/resolv.conf`, for our system, it's configured in `bootstrap/startup.json.default`,
# and a patch is added in `core/tools/blueos_startup_update` so systems with older bootstrap
# versions can also work with it.
# One detail is that because docker uses `mount` to bind the host's file to the container's file,
# if the file-descriptor of the file changes, the bind will be lost. To prevent this, the file being
# binded must be a hard link to the actual `/etc/resolv.conf`, and that hard link file is the one
# being binded. This hard link is being done in `core/tools/blueos_startup_update` as
# `/etc/resolv.conf.host`.
# To briefly understand why it is necessary, when the docker starts a container, it generates
# the container `/etc/resolv.conf` based on the host's one, or some docker configuration, however,
# during the container's lifetime, if the host's DNS configuration changes, the container's DNS
# doesn't follow it, making the container (possibly) unable to resolve DNSs correctly, failing
# the BlueOS Helper's internet connection check. By syncing the container's resolv.conf with the
# host's one, we make sure the container's DNS configuration follows the host's changes, thus,
# ensuring the container is able to resolve DNSs correctly.

# These services have priority because they do the fundamental for the vehicle to work,
# and by initializing them first we reduce the time users have to wait to control the vehicle.
# From tests with QGC and Pi3, the reboot time was ~1min42s when not using this strategy,
# and ~1min30s using this strategy.
# From that 1min30s, the startup time is about ~25s, and originally, ~37s, meaning that the
# remaining (~65 seconds) is the docker shutting down, and the Linux booting up.
